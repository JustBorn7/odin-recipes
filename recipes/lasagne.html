		<h1>Lasagne</h1>
        <p><img src="lasagne.jpg" alt="Classic italian lasagne" height="300" width="300"></p>
        <p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. 
            It's excellent if you want to impress some guests  or even yourself.
             It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>
             <h1>Ingredients</h1>
             <ul>
                <li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
                <li>1 cup semolina flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>3 ounces lean ground beef</li>
                <li>bechamel</li>
    
             </ul>
             <h1>Steps</h1>
             <ol>
                <li>Cook pasta: Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into 3 portions. 
                    Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. Cook each pasta sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth. </li>
                    <li>Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. Cook for 1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Assemble lasagna: Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the bechamel, 1/3 of the ricotta,
                         and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining bechamel and Parmesan; dot with butter.</li>
                         <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
             </ol>
